Here we have a collection of resources about the AR - IoT Combo Project
## Description
This project is a proof of concept (POC), concretely demonstrating the combined use of AR and IoT in a prototyped “micro production cell” (MPC) environment. IoT devices and components are introduced to support basic operations, and AR apps permit the interaction, monitoring, and control of IoT components.
